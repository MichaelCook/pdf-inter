pdf-inter
=========

Take two PDF documents and interleave their pages.

For scanners that have an auto-feed feature but can only scan one side, take
two PDF documents and interleave their pages.  The first document is the front
pages, numbered low to high.  The second document is the back pages, numbered
high to low.  The output is a single PDF with all of the pages interleaved in
the right order.
